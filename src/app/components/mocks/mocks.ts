          'Tariffs were \nincreased on steel and aluminum\n. But Trump’s trade agenda was largely characterized by threats and spats: rhetoric but not reality.\nOn Wednesday, dubbed “liberation day” by Trump and his aides, he did his best to draw a sharp line under weeks of wavering, doubt and confusion – and imposed the universal and “reciprocal” tariffs he pledged so many times to introduce while fighting to regain the White House.\nDefying the stark forecasts and concerns of mainstream economists and corporations, Trump went with his gut. “That was true of the Brexiteers, was it not? They really believed it deeply from the core of their souls,” said Sabato.\nAt one point during his address, Trump switched from president to historian. “In 1913, for reasons unknown to mankind, they established the income tax,” he said, setting the stage for a sharp reduction in tariffs on foreign goods. “Citizens, rather than foreign countries, would start paying the money necessary to run our government.”\nDecades of US prosperity “came to a very abrupt end” with the Great Depression from 1929, Professor Trump opined before his class of aides, cabinet secretaries and supporters. “It would have never happened if they had stayed with the tariff policy,” he claimed. “It would have been a much different story.”',
          'Donald Trump\n’s \nvast overhaul\n of US trade policy this week has called time on an era of globalization, \nalarming people\n, governments and investors around the world. No one should have been surprised,\nthe US president said.\nThe announcement of 10% to 50% tariffs on US trading partners tanked \nstock markets\n after Trump unveiled a “declaration of economic independence” so drastic it drew comparison with Britain’s exit from the European Union – \nBrexit\n.\nBut \nTrump, who won re-election\n promising that tariffs would make America great again, has advocated for the return of \nwidespread tariffs\n with “great consistency” for decades. “I’ve been talking about it for 40 years,” he noted in the White House Rose Garden.\nMany \nbusinesses\n, \neconomists\n and \npoliticians\n believe Trump’s trade plan is wrongheaded, \nflawed\n and risky. Some have even suggested it might have been \nwritten by ChatGPT\n. But he is unquestionably right when it comes to the number of decades he has argued for it.\n“This is so unusual for Trump. He’s a conventional politician in one way: he doesn’t believe in much deeply,” Larry Sabato, the director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. Tariffs are different. “This one thing, he seems to deeply believe in.”\nAs far back as 1987, when a fame-hungry real estate tycoon took out \nfull-page ads in newspapers',
          'As far back as 1987, when a fame-hungry real estate tycoon took out \nfull-page ads in newspapers\n, the now president called for such a strategy. Other major economies are the “greatest profit machines ever created”, he argued way back when. “‘Tax’ these wealthy nations, not America.”\nEight years after the start of his first term and just 10 weeks into his second, he has finally set about seriously delivering that dream – and cast aside warnings it may deteriorate into a nightmare.\nOn the campaign trail last year, Trump made no secret of his vision: tariffs would unshackle the US economy, he promised, revitalize its industrial heartlands and unlock a gigantic financial windfall for the federal government.\nBut after pitching this big, beautiful and bold reconstruction of the global economic order, the early actions of the second Trump administration were strikingly smaller, messier and altogether more hesitant than trailed.\nThe focus, at first, narrowed dramatically from the world to \njust a handful of nations\n: China, Canada and Mexico. While China was hit hard, sweeping tariffs on Canada and Mexico were interrupted by a dizzying array of deadlines, delays and dispensations.\nTariffs were \nincreased on steel and aluminum\n. But Trump’s trade agenda was largely characterized by threats and spats: rhetoric but not reality.',

          'Donald Trump\n backed down on \nsome of his largest tariffs\n Wednesday afternoon, though the trade war is far from over and the US is still imposing\n major levies on Chinese goods\n and a 10% tariff on the vast majority of its other imports.\nAll imports are subject to 10% tariffs, with higher tariffs still in place for certain industries like steel, aluminum and cars. As of Wednesday, the president put a 125% tariff on all Chinese imports.\nTrump paused his \n“reciprocal tariffs” \nfor the next 90 days but the baseline tariffs will impact the economy. Prices are likely to go up across the board, from blueberries to new cars, imported wine and chocolates. Exactly when and how is unclear, though economists who study trade policy and the supply chain have a broad idea of how things will go down.\nHere’s what we know so far about how tariffs will impact prices.\n“It’s hard to know how these retailers are going to deal with this increase in cost,” said Katheryn Russ, an economics professor at University of California at Davis. “Different businesses are going to have to decide at various points along the supply chain how much it costs to suck it up themselves in the form of a squeeze on their profit margins, or pass it on to their customers.”\nOver the last few months, as Trump threatened his tariffs, business leaders from companies like Best Buy, Levi Strauss & Co, AutoZone and Walmart have said they would have to pass increased costs on to consumers.',

          'It was not immediately clear whether the new tariffs would be in addition to what is already in place, or higher or lower adjustments.\nTrump’s comments expose the difficulty of the task the president set for his administration after imposing sweeping border taxes on goods imports from all of the US’s trading partners on his 2 April “liberation day”.\nWashington has withdrawn some of its toughest measures after a backlash in the bond markets, including pausing “reciprocal” tariff rates on many trading partners, including the EU, striking a trade deal to lower tariffs with the UK, and agreeing a 90-day pause with China. A 10% universal tariff on all imported foreign goods remains.\nEarlier this week, Trump hailed a “total reset” in relations between China and the US after the countries \nagreed the pause\n, which included Beijing lowering its duties on American goods to 10%, while the US tax on Chinese goods will be lowered to 30%.\nThe White House has signalled it is \nprioritising talks with dozens of the US’s largest trading partners\n, including India, South Korea and Japan, while negotiations with the EU are ongoing.\nHowever, his comments suggest Washington lacks the bandwidth to negotiate with hundreds of countries at once, while indicating that the president will instead push to dictate terms.\nThe impact of Trump’s tariff strategy continues to materialise in the US.

          'Some White House officials are known to have panicked about the rising cost of financing US debt, and Republican senators and state governors had also voiced concerns. It appears Trump was unable to maintain his punitive tariffs and compromised by \nimplementing a 90-day pause\n on most countries and raising those targeted at China.\nMost investors breathed a sigh of relief and analysts said sense had prevailed when Trump announced he would be pausing the bulk of his most punitive tariffs.\nHowever, tariffs on US imports will remain at the highest level since the 1930s. And reductions were supposed to only happen after a negotiated settlement with each country. The arbitrary reduction in all tariffs to the minimum 10%, excluding cars, aluminium and steel, means they could rise again.\nThen there is the battle with China, which shows every prospect of worsening. No one is sure how the dispute will be resolved. It matters when the world’s largest consumer (the US) is putting \nat least 145% tariffs\n on the world’s largest manufacturer – which has \nbrought in its own 84% tariff on US goods\n. There will be implications for the global economy and spill-over effects to all economies that are little understood at the moment.\nAccusations of insider trading, market manipulation and corruption more broadly are being \nlevelled at the White House\n as Trump switches tactics.',

          'Donald Trump\n’s climbdown on Wednesday from the most draconian aspects of his \ntariff regime\n has uncovered a damning picture of chaos at the heart of his presidency without necessarily alleviating their most painful effects.\nThe president’s landmark “liberation day” unveiling of tariffs in the White House Rose Garden on 2 April was supposed to be symbolic gateway to his promised “golden age of American greatness”; instead, it triggered a cascade of global market crashes that prompted warnings of a recession, or even a 1930s-style depression, while Trump brushed it all off as temporary “disruption”.\nTime alone will tell how much damage has been inflicted on the credibility of Trump’s economic policy and indeed his entire administration by the ditching of nearly 80 years of US economic and free trading architecture, only to be followed by a sharp, if partial, U-turn.\nThe president’s sudden and unheralded retreat from a signature policy that he has advocated for more than four decades has placated Wall Street and international bond markets, which rallied at the news of his 90-day pause on tariffs that rose to above 50% on the goods from some countries deemed to have been “ripping off” the US in their trade practices.',
          'But left untouched was a 10% across-the-board duty levied on all foreign imports – not to mention a further tariff hike on all goods from China – meaning that higher consumer prices are on the way for Americans, no matter how relieved the masters of the universe on Wall Street and other international trading centers are feeling.\n“Most Americans care less about the spin and more about the fact that his 10% across-the-board tariff will still cost families an average of $2,600 more annually,” Matt McDermott, a Democratic pollster, \nposted\n on Bluesky.\nThe market mayhem unleashed by Trump’s “liberation day” tariff rollout is reminiscent of the reaction to the attempt by the British prime minister, Liz Truss, to stage a radical reordering of UK economic policy in 2022.\nThe constitutional niceties of the America’s political system will no doubt save the president from the fate of the hapless Truss, who was memorably outlasted by a head of lettuce and driven from Downing Street within 50 days of taking office as international markets rejected her policies as non-credible.\nNo such mechanism exists for removing a US president whose policies trigger market turmoil at home and abroad.\nPerhaps buoyed up by that knowledge, Trump’s closest aides and acolytes tried to present his political backflip as a sign of strategic genius that had always been part of a brilliant plan.',

          '“The escalating tariffs are a body blow to the global trading system,” said Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University, and a former official at the International Monetary Fund.\nWherever you stand, a move on this scale would constitute a radical shake-up – and set the stage for a fundamental overhaul of the US economy. And yet, even as he ramped up the rhetoric, Trump has appeared to tread carefully.\n“I will immediately begin the overhaul of our trade system to protect American workers and families,” the president declared at his inauguration in January. “Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens.”\nWhile the threats were immediate, the action was not.\nTake Canada and Mexico. The administration has adopted a strikingly hardline stance against the US’s largest and nearest trading partners, but its imposition of blanket tariffs has been hit by a dizzying array of shifting deadlines, delays and reversals.\nAn initial pledge to impose tariffs from “day one” shifted, without explanation, to February. When February rolled around, a last-ditch deal kicked the can to March. When the tariffs were finally imposed, it was a little over 24 hours before carmakers were \ngranted a temporary exemption\n, and 48 hours before all goods covered by an existing trade deal between the US, Mexico and Canada were \nspared for another month\n.',
          'granted a temporary exemption\n, and 48 hours before all goods covered by an existing trade deal between the US, Mexico and Canada were \nspared for another month\n.\nAll the while, Trump and his most senior officials have slowly, but surely, accepted the risks they are raising in pursuit of the rewards they have vowed to obtain.\n“Tariffs don’t cause inflation,” the president \nclaimed in January\n. OK, prices “could go up somewhat short term”, he \nconceded in February\n. “There’ll be a little disturbance,” he \nadded in March\n, stressing that he was alright with that.\nThe US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, \nacknowledged earlier this month\n that there may well be a “one-time price adjustment” as a result of Trump’s tariffs. “Access to cheap goods is not the essence of the American dream,” he argued.\nWhile Trump predicts that slapping high US tariffs on foreign goods will prompt an influx of international companies to make products inside the US, rather than out, companies and investors worldwide are already \nstruggling to keep up\n with his administration’s erratic trade policymaking.\nSo far, since his return to office, Trump has hiked tariffs on Chinese exports to the US and raised tariffs on foreign steel and aluminium to 25%.\nThe average US tariff rate has already shot up from 2.5% to 8.4% this year, the highest level since 1946, according to the Tax Foundation.',

          'This advice seemed prescient four hours later. Seven days into the new chapter, with his individualized tariffs imposed for all of 13 hours, Trump announced a 90-day pause – in effect reducing the universal duty on all US imports from almost all countries to 10% – and markets surged higher.\nAlmost all countries, that is, except China. Beijing’s pledge to hit back infuriated the president, who blamed its “lack of respect” as he announced a new US tariff of 125% (in effect, once other duties were included, 145%) on Chinese goods. It retaliated in kind.\nThe same officials who had been dispatched to defend Trump’s initial plan were sent out again, to explain his latest climbdown.\n“You have been watching the greatest economic master strategy from an American President in history,” Miller claimed on X.\n“Many of you in the media clearly missed The Art of the Deal,” the press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, scolded reporters, referring to the president’s 1987 bestseller, in which the real estate tycoon presented himself as a consummate dealmaker.\nWhile his aides claimed that more than 75 countries had been in touch following his initial tariff announcement, even the president struggled to present the reversal as part of a carefully orchestrated negotiating strategy. Asked what had prompted it, Trump told reporters people had been “getting a little bit yippy” about his plan.',
          '“I’m not saying Donald Trump has changed what he thinks in his heart. But he’s backed into a corner, and he needs to get off this crazy tariff train, and he knows it.”\nTrump punched back. “Few people know Stephanie Ruhle, but I do, and she doesn’t have what it takes,” he wrote on Truth Social, accusing her of lies. “We’re going to make a fortune with Tariffs, only smart people understand that, and Stephanie was never known as a ‘High IQ’ person.”\nIf only smart people understood the US stood to make a fortune from tariffs, they might have been surprised by what happened next.\nAway from TV studios, some of the most senior people in the White House, including the chief of staff, Susie Wiles, reportedly started to warn the president of risks not unlike those laid out by Ruhle. “The key argument was that this was beginning to hurt Trump’s supporters – Trump’s people,” one person briefed on internal conversations \ntold the Washington Post\n. “It gave Susie a key window.”\nOn day 40, after discussions in Geneva, Bessent confirmed that US and Chinese officials would \ndrastically reduce the tariffs\n they had aggressively ratcheted up just a few weeks before. With US tariffs on Chinese goods falling to 30%, Trump hailed a “total reset” in relations between Washington and Beijing.\nThe reversal, although far from a total reset, confined the latest “liberation day” measure to history.',
          'On day 36, the first deal was \ndeclared done\n. Trump summoned back reporters to unveil what he called a “maxed-out deal that we’re going to make bigger” with the UK. In reality, there was still work to do: both he and Keir Starmer, the British prime minister, conceded certain details had yet to be finalized.\nBy the next morning, Trump’s focus had returned to China. Bessent was preparing for talks with the country’s officials in Geneva, fueling hopes that the world’s two largest economies might lower their eye-watering tariffs. “80% Tariff on China seems right! Up to Scott B,” the president wrote on social media.\nTrump was also watching the liberal MSNBC network, where the business commentator Stephanie Ruhle argued his strategy on tariffs was not working. “You’re seeing day in, day out, more business leaders – whether it’s Warren Buffett, or Jamie Dimon, or Ken Griffin, on big global stages – saying this is going to crush us economically,” she said. “And then you’ve got congressmen, senators, from every state saying to this White House: our small businesses are … dying here.\n“I’m not saying Donald Trump has changed what he thinks in his heart. But he’s backed into a corner, and he needs to get off this crazy tariff train, and he knows it.”',

          'The White House has relented on many of its most onerous tariffs, including lowering \ntotal tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30%\n after what Trump declared were constructive talks with Beijing, which lowered its retaliatory border taxes from 125% to 10% in response.\nA week ago the US president appeared to acknowledge that Washington lacked the ability to negotiate deals with scores of countries at once, saying the US would instead send letters to some trading partners to \nunilaterally impose new tariff rates\n.\nPerceptions of an easing back on a hardline approach to trade brought a period of calm to stock markets, but Friday’s threat of a 50% levy on EU goods, plus a separate threat \nmade the same day of 25% tariffs on iPhones made abroad\n, have brought an end to the peace.\nThe EU presented a fresh trade proposal to the US on Thursday. The offer included phased tariff cuts on non-sensitive goods, plus cooperation on energy, AI and digital infrastructure. The bloc was readying about $108bn in retaliatory tariffs if talks failed.\nTo sweeten the deal, EU officials were also willing to extend a 2020 tariff-free arrangement on US lobster imports, \naccording to the Financial Times\n. But it appears to have proved insufficient to persuade the US president to sign a deal allowing only his 10% universal tariff to apply to the EU, as it does the UK.',

          'Donald Trump\n pulled back from his trade war with \nCanada\nand \nMexico\n on Thursday, temporarily delaying tariffs on many goods from the two countries once again.\nTwo days after imposing sweeping tariffs on all imports from his country’s closest trading partners, the US president announced that duties on a wide range of products would be shelved until April.\nThere are “no delays at all”, he told reporters in the Oval Office, signing an order that postponed the tariffs.\nTrump has already softened the attack on Canada and Mexico, \ngranting carmakers a one-month reprieve\n after they warned of widespread disruption. Top retail CEOs have also been \nbracing customers for significant price increases\n in grocery stores within days.\nAfter a call with Claudia Sheinbaum, the Mexican president, Trump declared: “Mexico will not be required to pay Tariffs on anything” that falls under an existing trade deal between the US, Mexico and Canada known as USMCA.\nTariffs are not paid by countries, but importers – in this case, US companies – that buy products from businesses in the targeted countries.\nHours later, Trump signed an amendment which extended the same relief to Canada until 2 April. Earlier in the day he had pointedly attacked Justin Trudeau, his Canadian counterpart, claiming he was “using the Tariff problem” to stay in office.',
          'Trump said the reversal has “nothing to do” with turbulence in the stock market in recent days, as investors weigh his economic plans. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 fell 1.8% on Thursday. “I’m not even looking at the market,” he claimed.\nDuring the president’s \njoint address to Congress\n on Tuesday evening, he acknowledged that tariffs would cause disruption. There will be “a little disturbance, but we’re OK with that”, he said.\nTrump had initially pledged to target Canada and Mexico with tariffs on his first day back in office. Upon his return, however, he said he was considering imposing the tariffs at the start of February. Last month, he offered Canada and Mexico a one-month delay at the 11th hour.\nOnly on Tuesday did he \npull the trigger\n, imposing 25% duties all goods from Mexico, and 25% duties on most goods from Canada, with 10% duties on Canadian energy products. He also doubled a tariff on Chinese exports from 10% to 20%.\nTrump and his allies claim that higher tariffs on US imports from across the world will help “make America great again”, by enabling it to obtain political and economic concessions from allies and rivals on the global stage.\nBut businesses, both \ninside the US\n and \nworldwide\n, have warned of significant damage to companies and consumers if the \nTrump administration\n pushes ahead with this strategy.',

          'Trump’s top trade official, Jamieson Greer, told the US Senate that Argentina, Vietnam and Israel were among those who had offered to reduce their tariffs.\nTrump originally announced a 34% additional tariff on Chinese goods. However, after China announced its own 34% counter-tariff on American products, he vowed to pile on another 50% duty. Counting existing levies imposed in February and March, that would take the cumulative tariff increase for Chinese goods during Trump’s second presidency to 104%.\nThe new US tariffs imposed on 57 target countries, territories and blocs include rates of 20% on the EU, 26% on India and 49% on Cambodia.\nThe EU has sought to cool tensions, with the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, warning against worsening the trade conflict in a call with the Chinese premier, Li Qiang.\nVon der Leyen stressed stability for the world’s economy, alongside “the need to avoid further escalation”, an EU readout said.\nThe French president, Emmanuel Macron, called on Trump to reconsider, adding that if the EU was forced to respond then “so be it”.',

He claimed his administration would introduce tariffs on farm products from 2 April.\nA string of such deadlines – including vows to hit Canada and Mexico with tariffs in January, and then February – have been delayed, however, as economists and business leaders urge caution.\n“To the Great Farmers of the United States: Get ready to start making a lot of agricultural product to be sold INSIDE of the United States,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, his social network, on Monday. “Tariffs will go on external product on April 2nd. Have fun!”',

          'After a call with Mexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, on Monday, Trump agreed to postpone tariffs of 25% on Mexico – the latest of several delays – after she offered to send 10,000 of the country’s troops to its border with the US.\nTalks with Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, also prompted Trump to postpone 25% tariffs on the country. Canada is implementing a $1.3bn border plan, Trudeau said, and will appoint a fentanyl tsar, list cartels as a terrorists and “ensure 24/7 eyes on the border”.\nAs the US readied higher tariffs on China on Monday, the White House announced that Trump would speak later this week with China’s president, Xi Jinping. Beijing earlier pledged to hit back with “countermeasures” and file a legal case against the US at the World Trade Organization.\nEconomists have warned Trump’s tariff plans risk raising prices for millions of Americans, only weeks after he pledged, upon taking office, to “rapidly” bring them down.\nAddressing reporters in the Oval Office on Monday, Trump maintained that tariffs were a “very powerful” means of strengthening the US economically and “getting everything else you want”.\nEvery country wanted to agree a way to avoid US tariffs, the president claimed. “In all cases, they all wanna make deals.”',

  answer:
    'Trump initially imposed sweeping tariffs on imports from various countries, including a universal 10% tariff on all imports and higher rates for specific countries like China (up to 125%). However, he later backed down on some of his largest tariffs, implementing a 90-day pause for many countries while maintaining the 10% baseline tariff and reducing Chinese tariffs from 145% to 30% after negotiations with Beijing.',
