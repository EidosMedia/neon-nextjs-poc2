# Next.js headless app with Neon example

## The idea behind the example

The project uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), and shows how it is possible to integrate it with Eidosmedia NEON headless APIs.

WARNING: this code is not meant to be used in production! Many implementations are done "quick & dirty": the goal is NOT to provide Next.js or React development best practices - the goal is only to illustrate how to interact with Neon APIs.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
